Assessment 3: Mid-Term Practical Test
Student: Mathew Kasanga
Problem: 4

Issues Identified:
1. Public static companyName violates encapsulation.
2. Constructor did not initialize salary properly.
3. setSalary method incorrectly assigned parameter to itself.
4. Negative salary handling was weak (only printed message).
5. calculateBonus method had wrong return type (void instead of double).
6. Missing getters/setters for fields.

Corrections:
- Made companyName private static with getter/setter.
- Added salary initialization in constructor with validation.
- Fixed setSalary to use this.salary.
- Added InvalidSalaryException for negative salary cases.
- Changed calculateBonus to return double.
- Added displayEmployeeInfo() for clarity.
